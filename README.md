  <b>Web Application for Spectral Packing Visualization</b>
</p>

## Overview

`packing-sim` is a web application that implements graphics algorithms for spectral packing of 3D objects. It provides a visual representation of the packing process, allowing users to simulate how objects can be densely arranged within a container. This project is inspired by the research paper [Spectral Packing](https://inkbit3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spectralPacking_optimized.pdf).

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization of the packing process.
- Efficient placement search based on graphics algorithms.
- Spectral packing inspired by the research paper.
## Demo
TBA
